# San7orini

A Ruby on Rails application to develop different features. It might get ugly but you know, *Rome was not built in a day*.

## Dev

### Environment

- Ruby 3.0.2
- Rails 7.0.0
- Yarn
- [puma-dev](https://github.com/puma/puma-dev)
  **Why?** With OmniAuth, for security purposes, Facebook needs a HTTPs request from the application.
  With this, I can work with the host `https://san7orini.test`.

### Setup

- Clone this repo
- Run `bin/setup`
- Run `yarn`
- Set up credentials based on `config/credentials-example.yml`

### Run

Magic happens by running `bin/dev`.
